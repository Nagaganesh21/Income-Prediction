# Income-Prediction
The project aims to predict income levels based on various demographic and
employment-related features using machine learning algorithms. We explore different models, evaluate their performance, and provide insights into the factors that contribute to higher income levels. The importance of this project lies in, for example, helping non-profit organizations evaluate their much-needed donation requests from different individuals.
